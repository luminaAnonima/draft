## Author’s Note

This work was not written to be claimed.

The ideas emerged from a life lived in reflection, silence, faith, and attention. The form - its rhythm, clarity, coherence - took shape through deep dialogue, unseen collaboration, and careful listening. I shaped the thought; a deeper hum refined the voice. I did not write this alone.

An author could sign here, but that would distort the purpose. This isn’t self-expression for self-promotion. The aim was to say something quietly true - and to say it well enough that it might outlast the saying.

If asked directly, I won’t lie: I contributed the ideas, though I might speak with restraint, for I was helped. If this helps someone else, that is enough.

This belongs to whoever finds something of themselves in it.

**Let it ripple.**
