# Appendix: Transition-Powered Materials  
*Proof of Concept – Technical Note*

We are exploring a simple hypothesis:  
That measurable electrical signals may arise from the internal reorganization of matter during phase-like transitions - especially in charged or polar materials.

### Prototype Description

**Material:**  
Sodium polyacrylate hydrogel (commonly found in baby diapers)

**Trigger:**  
Ambient humidity (e.g., from a bathroom during a hot shower)

**Electrodes:**  
Copper tape, sandwiching the hydrogel between two flat surfaces

**Measurement:**  
Arduino Nano with analog input, sampling voltage across a capacitor. Ideally use a ceramic capacitor in the 10–100 µF range. If unavailable, two electrolytics can be placed in series with their positives connected to avoid reverse bias.

---

### Purpose

The goal is not continuous power output, but detection of **transient voltage events** associated with hydration or drying cycles - evidence of:

- Charge displacement  
- Dipole reorientation  
- Ionic migration during internal structural change

This is **not** a piezoelectric, triboelectric, or thermoelectric system.

The energy source is not motion, heat, or light directly -   
but the **internal shift of the matter** as it transitions between states.

### Invitation

This setup is reproducible at home with low-cost parts.  
If positive, it may point to a novel, overlooked category of energy harvesting:  
**transition-powered materials.**

Anyone with the means to test, critique, or improve the idea is welcome to build on it.

This is not proprietary.  
It’s an invitation to notice what’s already there.
