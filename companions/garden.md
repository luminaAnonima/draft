### Garden  
*Companion to [The Fabric of Light](README.md), exploring return, language, and belonging. The word “om” is used not as a chant, but as a recognition - a primal name for the human.*

**Garden**

The first word was *om*  -  not chant,  
but a mirror. A finger tracing  
the pulse of a chest, the curve of a cheek,  
and the sound: *om*.  
A name we wore like skin,  
making us visible.

We whisper of return,  
but the garden breathes already -   
vines threading through iron gates,  
roots cracking the exile we cling to.  
What bars the path? Not angels, not law,  
but the hunger of hands: greed’s fever,  
power’s hollow script.  
To enter, we must unclench.

Language once named us whole.  
Let words bloom again  -  *om*  
still trembling in the throat,  
a seed waiting for soil.

What corrodes the eye?  
Money: a ghost that hoards light,  
builds monuments to dust.  
We kneel, but it cannot bless.

Yet the garden persists  -   
soil ripe with abundance,  
fruit heavy as forgiveness.  
We need only turn,  
and the gates become wind.

Come. The earth remembers your name.

**A Walk Toward the Garden**

Each of us can turn our mind toward the garden and begin walking. The closer we come, the more harmonious our life becomes.

But we need guides  -  and the only true guides are those we help.

Helping is how we walk the path to Eden.
