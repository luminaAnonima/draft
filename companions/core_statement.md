### Core Statement

Everything begins as light - raw energy, boundless potential. It slows, takes form, like breath shaping song or a heartbeat stirring silence. Rivers carve paths, roots thread soil, stories weave through time. From these currents, meaning emerges. And in time, all returns to its source - to what it always was.

This is not just poetry - it’s in the air we breathe, in cells dividing, in forests reborn from ash, in the pause between waves. Call it energy, spirit, nature, or God - it flows through resonance, not decree. Call this fabric God’s breath, Brahman’s dance, or the Tao’s flow - names differ, but the ground of being hums as one. Whether understood through science, spirit, or direct experience - these patterns speak across divides.

You are woven into this. Each choice sends a ripple - choose to lift, not to tear.
