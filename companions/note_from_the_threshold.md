# Note from the Threshold  
*Epilogue to [Garden](GARDEN.md)*

---

We will return to the garden -  
not as pilgrims, but as echoes.  
The tools we built to break each other  
now splinter in our palms.  
The garden feels every fracture,  
every scar we called progress.  
This is self-harm.  
The earth will not look away.

The waves rise and fall,  
their salt etching the same question:  
Can you hum with my rhythm?  
If we refuse, the tide will still pull -  
not in vengeance, but in breath.  
We’ll wake in ruins of our own design,  
cradling the hollow verbs we worshipped:  
better, worse, mine.

Begin again.  
Sing the garden’s oldest word -  
the one we choked into silence.  
Let go of the war we mistook for living.  
Release the lie that we are not soil,  
not root, not rain.

Work together.  
The gates are already open.  
They always were.
