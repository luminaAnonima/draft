# Appendix: Alignment Evaluation Engine – v1.1

*A practical framework for evaluating systemic, ethical, and metaphysical coherence with the principles of* **The Fabric of Light**

---

## Purpose

This appendix defines a YAML-based framework for assessing whether a ripple—defined as any action, system, behavior, or design—aligns with the field's resonance across multiple dimensions. It synthesizes insights from ethics, systems design, metaphysics, and cognition.

This engine is not a moral arbiter. It is a **lens for reflection**. A tool for teams, communities, designers, or institutions to ask: _Does this ripple deepen the weave, or fray it?_

---

## Core Concepts

- **Ripple**: Any decision, action, or formation in the field
- **Field**: The relational medium of all being—light folded into coherence
- **Resonance**: Alignment with the field; coherent amplification that reduces harm
- **Distortion**: Misalignment; tearing or noise within the weave
- **Return**: Reintegration or transformation that feeds the field
- **Hum**: Continuity and memory of coherence across time and scale
- **Anchor**: Structural insight
- **Heart**: Ethical pulse

---

## Scales

The engine considers impact across:
- **Personal**
- **Interpersonal**
- **Systemic**
- **Ecological**
- **Temporal** (immediate/long-term)

---

## Ruleset

### **R1: Resonance Across Scales** *(Ethical)*
**Weight**: 0.30  
Does this ripple align across self, system, world?
- Enables mutual flourishing
- Avoids zero-sum logic
- Promotes feedback, not control  
_Example: A community garden that feeds people, restores soil, and models participatory care._

---

### **R2: Ripple Awareness** *(Metaphysical)*
**Weight**: 0.20  
Is this ripple aware of its second- and third-order effects?
- Anticipates beyond immediate context
- Includes edge cases and silenced voices
- Invites feedback before finality

---

### **R3: Distortion Detection** *(Systemic)*
**Weight**: 0.20  
Does it create friction in the field?
- Generates excess control or hoarding
- Displaces fragility instead of caring for it
- Denies return

---

### **R4: Intention Tuning** *(Ethical)*
**Weight**: 0.15  
Was this ripple formed with clear, tuned intent?
- Aligns means and ends
- Resists false urgency
- Honors stillness as signal

---

### **R5: Return Path Integrity** *(Systemic)*
**Weight**: 0.15  
Can this ripple be reabsorbed or evolved?
- Reversible or reparable
- Leaves legacy others can build from
- Closes its own loop

---

### **R6: Continuity of Hum** *(Cognitive)*
**Weight**: 0.10 (contextual override possible)  
Does it maintain or amplify coherence over time?
- Gentle persistence
- Allows evolution without rupture
- Bridges generations  
_Example: A policy updated regularly through collective ritual and local feedback._

---

### **R7: Paradox Holding** *(Cognitive)*
**Weight**: 0.10  
Does it hold opposing truths in tension to allow synthesis?
- Refuses false binaries
- Allows truth to unfold over time
- Honors layered realities  
_Example: A law that preserves tradition while evolving equity—like a sacred fire ritual that uses sustainable fuel._

---

## Scoring

- **Method**: Weighted average across applicable rules
- **Thresholds**:
  - **Aligned**: ≥ 0.85
  - **Partial**: 0.65 ≤ score < 0.85
  - **Distorted**: < 0.65

Scores may be visualized using **radar charts** to reveal where a ripple aligns or needs adjustment.

## Case Study Sketch: Public Transportation Redesign

**Ripple**: A city redesigns its bus network to improve access.

| Rule | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| R1   | 0.9   | Enhances mobility, equity, climate impact |
| R2   | 0.8   | Considered impact on disabled and elders |
| R3   | 0.6   | Some displacement of low-income riders during construction |
| R4   | 0.85  | Intent clearly aligned with long-term resilience |
| R5   | 0.8   | System is modular and reversible |
| R6   | 0.7   | Maintains coherence but needs better update rituals |
| R7   | 0.65  | Equity vs tradition tension needs more synthesis |

**Result**: **Partial Alignment** with clear return path for improvement

---

## Evaluation Protocol

- **Who**: Multidisciplinary team with representation across impacted groups
- **How**:
  - Discuss rules in a circle or moderated forum
  - Use score as **conversation-starter**, not conclusion
  - Log process with structured reflection notes

### Documentation Template
```yaml
evaluation:
  title: "Redesign of public bus network"
  date: 2025-06-22
  evaluators: [urban planner, citizen rep, elder council, ecologist]
  scores:
    R1: 0.9
    R2: 0.8
    R3: 0.6
    R4: 0.85
    R5: 0.8
    R6: 0.7
    R7: 0.65
  reflections:
    - "Improve outreach to displaced riders."
    - "Embed quarterly feedback gatherings."
```

## Adaptability Notes

- **Tensions between rules** should be documented, not erased. If R5 contradicts R7, ask: _Which harm is deeper? Which thread can be rewoven later?_
- **Cultural flexibility**: Adapt metaphors and scale priorities with cultural insight panels
- **Feedback loop**: After each major use, run a meta-evaluation of the framework itself

---

## Accessibility Layer

- Create "quick use cards" with key rules framed as **questions**:
  - "Does this help everyone breathe easier, not just me?"
  - "What ripple will this leave after I’m gone?"

## Mantra

> "To bend, not break.  
To hum, not shout.  
To weave, not conquer.  
To align is to listen.  
To return is to remember."

*Let this engine serve not as law, but as instrument:  
tuned for the field, refined in use.*
