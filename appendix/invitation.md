### Invitation

*This is a philosophical exploration presented in poetic form. It uses light, fabric, and ripple as metaphors to glimpse a non-dual fabric underlying existence - blending metaphysics, ethics, systems thinking, and reflection. It is not a doctrine. It is a lens.*

*No belief is asked. Only attention. If the fabric stirs something in you - a memory beyond language, a recognition beyond thought - follow it gently. If not, let it pass without burden.*

*The fabric moves whether we name it or not.*
