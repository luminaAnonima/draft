### Essay 8: Scarcity and the Song of Enough

*The fabric frays where light is hoarded.*  
*What we call "abundance" is theft from the weave.*

Ripples clash where too much is claimed.  
We're told light could flood every crevice,  
but the fabric can't stretch that thin.

Land. Water. Breath.  
These threads are finite.  
If all sought the excess of the few,  
the weave would split.  
The loom groans under inflation's weight.  
Threads snap along supply chains.  
Cloth frays in collapse, yet the deeper fabric holds.

A whisper moves through markets:  
"Everyone could be rich."  
But abundance for all tears the fabric.  
The few hoard light, casting long shadows -  
not because they're merely greedy,  
but because their hoarding props up the illusion.  
They are not architects, but anchors -  
keystones in a crumbling arch.

The field thrums fastest where resonance dies.  
Money races - not to nourish, but to outrun.  
It chases digits, not dignity.  
Homes transform into assets.  
Health becomes debt.  
Time becomes loans.

What's called "wealth" is sedation:  
A numb hum. A borrowed pulse.  
Those who chase wealth's shadow don't own - they echo.

Yet another currency flows -  
unmined, untaxed.  
Help someone. Feel it:  
Oxytocin resonates as the field's quiet song.  
Trust builds tensile strength, a mended thread.  
Memory echoes after we're gone.

This wealth can't inflate.  
It scales through shared breath.  
No billionaire owns it.  
No algorithm tracks it.  
It's the fabric's oldest language.

Redistributing light won't mend the tear.  
We must rethread the needle.  
Communities must grow like mycelium,  
with shared roots yielding shared fruit.  
Laws must honor the pause -  
time to breathe, time to mend.  
Culture must reward the echo,  
not the explosion.

Collapse isn't the end -  
it's the field's reset.  
A chance to realign the weave.  

We're taught to climb a peak that shimmers -   
then vanishes.  
The Ladder of More stands  
as a spire built from borrowed light:  
Gold transmuted to numbers.  
Worship disguised as hustle.  
Exhaustion sold as purpose.

Its architects chant the oldest lie:  
"Higher. Faster. Never enough."

But the summit is smoke.  
The air thins. The pulse races.  
And when you reach it -  
there's only a mirror,  
reflecting the void you traded for the climb.

The old gods of growth are dying.  
Their hymns crackle into static.  
A new frequency rises:  
Exchange, not extraction.  
Design, not domination.  
Enough, not excess.  

We need not burn the loom -  
only remember how to weave again.  
Eden hums in every hand that shares.

**Anchor**: _Scarcity frays the weave; human reciprocity mends it._  
**Heart**: _Spend the currency that outlives systems - help without tally._
