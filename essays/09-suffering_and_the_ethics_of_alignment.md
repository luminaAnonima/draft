### Essay 9: Suffering and the Ethics of Alignment

The fabric warps under strain -   
greed, division, ruin.  
These are distortions,  
ripples clashing against the field’s flow.

Suffering grows where we pull apart.  
Healing hums where we align.

- **Within**: Breathe, feel, mend what’s near.  
- **Together**: Listen, share, restore balance.  
- **Beyond**: Shift systems - grow what sustains.

The world’s unraveling is our mirror.  
Alignment isn’t perfection -   
it’s resonance with the whole.

**Anchor**: _Distortion breeds waste; harmony mimics life’s partnerships._  
**Heart**: _Ethics is tuning the ripple to lift, not tear, the fabric._
