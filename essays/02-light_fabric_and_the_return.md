### Essay 2: Light, Fabric, and the Return

All begins with light - not just what we see,  
but the pulse of being itself.

It meets the fabric - its own echo -   
slowing into time, space, form.  
This friction isn’t flaw;  
it’s the lens that makes the invisible real.  
Without it, all stays a blur of potential.

Time bends where ripples break.  
No moment stands alone -   
death thins the form, not the presence.  
Light slips back, carrying its story to the source.  
The fabric never rests.  
Beginnings and ends are just our eyes lagging behind.

The task:  
Let light shine through us -   
not as owners, but as channels.  
Reality is light paused to know itself.  
When the pause lifts, clarity remains.

**Anchor**: _Light slows through relation; energy persists beyond form._  
**Heart**: _We’re not apart from the source - we’re its fleeting voice._
