### Essay 4: The Fabric Across Scales

**Small**: Entangled sparks entwine like lovers’ breath,  
singing as one in the field’s quiet pulse.

**Living**: Roots pulse with shared sap,  
rippling outward in patterns that bind leaf to lung, root to breath.

**Earth**: The earth inhales through tide and root,  
its rhythms mirrored in wing, wave, and whisper.

**Cosmos**: Stars bend light in a silent pull,  
threading galaxies through the loom of time.

From atom to galaxy,  
the field hums as one weave.

**Anchor**: _Links unseen (atoms), forms alive (cells), earth in tune (ecosystems), cosmos stretched (gravity) - all one weave._  
**Heart**: _Every scale hums together - act knowing your ripple resonates far beyond you._
