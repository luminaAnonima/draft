### Essay 6: The Fabric’s Warp

Ripples hum -   
but some clash.  
Knots form.  
Waves fray.

What begins as light’s dance  
twists into strain.  
Greed hoards.  
Fear divides.  
Hands tear what could mend.

These are not flaws apart from us -   
they are our ripples,  
bent against the weave.

Yet the fabric holds.

Where one pulls,  
another can soften.  
Resonance heals what distortion breaks.  
From a single life to a shared world -   
alignment turns chaos to song.

**Anchor**: _Human tension creates discordant waves; harmony realigns them._  
**Heart**: _The fabric bends with us - our hands shape its song._
