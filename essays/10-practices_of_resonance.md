### Essay 10: Practices of Resonance

Alone:  
Pause - five breaths to feel the hum.  
Note what stirs, what settles.

With Others:  
Gather - speak what’s unsaid,  
hear the shared pulse.  
Map your mark - does it heal or harm?

In the World:  
Build - measure acts by their ripple (less waste, more care).  
Push - shape rules to echo the field  (laws for renewal, not ruin).

We echo distant ripples,  
caught in patterns not our own,  
while those beside us fade unheard.

Return.  
Attend to what’s near -   
not the loudest wave, but the one that needs you.  

For some, 
resonance hums in bowed heads and chanted psalms.  
For others, 
in quiet breath.  
All are threads in the weave.

Menders show the way -   
we can follow.  
Lead by your hum;  
others will hear the song.  
Small shifts weave big songs.

**Anchor**: _Attention shapes waves; collectives amplify._  
**Heart**: _Practice is living the fabric - simple, steady, shared._
