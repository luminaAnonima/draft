### Essay 7: Power and the Fabric

Power twists the weave.  
Profit carves ruts.  
Hierarchy silences half the song.  
Excess breeds waste.  
Control dims the fieldâ€™s light.

Rebalance:

- Grow mutual webs.  
- Use tools that connect, not divide.  
- Build anew, soften the old.

The fabric holds no masters.  
It asks for hands that mend.

**Anchor**: _Power distorts resonance; balance restores flow._  
**Heart**: _Power bends - let it bend toward song._
