### Essay 5: Rebirth at the Edge of Stillness

A ripple fades -   
not lost,  
but reabsorbed into the field’s hum.

Energy doesn’t die.  
It rests in stillness, ripe for new form.

This isn’t return as before,  
but a fresh unfolding.  
Each end a seed.

When form thins, light slips free -   
not to vanish,  
but to ripple anew.  
Not as “you,”  
but as the field’s next breath.

Death is no wall.  
It’s a doorway to the adjacent unknown.

**Anchor**: _Energy shifts, never fades; life explores the possible._  
**Heart**: _Every end fuels a beginning - stillness hums with potential._
