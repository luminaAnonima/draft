### Field Note: When the Thread Snapped

*This reflection stands apart from the philosophical essays. It is not metaphor. It is memory - a lived echo of what happens when alignment frays, when belonging dissolves. Read it as witness. Then return to the thread.*

I grew up in Romania, in a place where Romanians and Saxons had shared the land for more than 850 years - a deep, layered presence. The Saxons were steady, quiet people - deeply tied to the land, their churches, their language. Their presence gave rhythm to our towns. When they left, something deep was broken. Not just houses and towers fell silent, but a whole way of life.

They didn’t leave for no reason. Life was hard. But for those who didn’t chase possessions, it offered something steady - shared purpose, equality, time together. But still, in my heart, their departure felt like a mistake. They were respected, even admired. They had a place among us. But they chose comfort over roots. They chose to be safe - elsewhere.

I don’t say this with judgment. I left too. I was 28 when I left Romania. I spent 25 years in the United States, and now I live in another land, a temporary stay. But my heart never left the Romanian village - a true commune, where time, food, and spirit were shared. It is, and always will be, my true home. Maybe life delays the return, but I’ll go back. Even if only at the very end.

Looking back, I see now - the Saxons were the first victims of something much larger. The spread of individualism. It started in the West, and it’s moving East like a slow wind, changing how people think and live.

In Romania, back then, we were all about the same. Some had a little more, some a little less, but the gap was small. That made us less materialistic. What mattered was human connection. Talking, meeting, sharing food, dancing, laughing. People had time. People had spirit.

In the system that replaced roots with growth, I found more wealth - but less joy. People have more, but trust less. They are freer, but lonelier. They move fast, but forget where from. Everyone seems to want more. A better car. A bigger house. A shinier title. And yet, they rarely smile. Rarely stop. Rarely feel they have enough.

Now I see it everywhere. The people in the region - one by one - pulled into this current.  
It promises freedom and comfort, but takes something with it: belonging. Community. Joy.

The Saxons were just the beginning.

We in Romania - and across Eastern Europe - were the battleground not just of empires, but of values.  
Community versus self. Roots versus restlessness.  
We didn’t lose to tanks, but to dreams of comfort. Advertisements, shows, promises of a “better life.”  
And one by one, the old ways faded.

I guess individualism won. For now.

But maybe not everything is lost. If some still carry the memory - not as nostalgia, but as compass - then something remains. A thread, not cut.  
I still remember how it felt to belong. To be shaped by place, by people, by time shared not bought. That memory isn't a wound - it's a map.  
I’ll return. Maybe others will too. Even if only at the end, the path will be there. Not paved, not marked. But still there.  
And if enough of us walk it - quietly, steadily - it becomes a road again.

The thread isn't gone. It's waiting to be picked up.
