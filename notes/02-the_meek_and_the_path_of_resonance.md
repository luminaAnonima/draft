### Field Note: The Meek and the Path of Resonance

The meek are not weak.  
They are tuned.

Not shouting, but listening.  
Not grasping, but aligning.  
Not rushing, but walking where the field flows.

They do not lead by force -  
they **invite** by example.  
Their silence carries more truth than many voices.

In a world obsessed with volume,  
the meek hold the pitch that heals.

**They are our guides.**  
Not to domination - but to resonance.  
Not to wealth - but to coherence.  
Not to victory - but to harmony.

*Follow them not with eyes upward, but with your own tuning fork in hand.*  
*They do not point - they resonate.*
